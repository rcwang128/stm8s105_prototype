# stm8s105_prototype
Prototype verification - Freq detection and cap calculation based on stm8s105 discovery


TIM1 - Input capture on channel 2 (PC2) to detect freq rising edge; fast and high resolutions.
TIM2 - Timer for sample resolution set (Hz range).
TIM3 - Ouput test freq.
TIM4 - For delay functions.
UART2 - Printf stuff through FT232.
